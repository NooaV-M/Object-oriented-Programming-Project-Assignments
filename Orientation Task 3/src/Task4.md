**Normal Distribution**

Often used to model occurrence of natural phenomena or traits in a population.
Often used in populations simulations.

**Binomial Distribution**

Used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (yes/no outcomes).
Often used in quality control and clinical trials.

**Poisson Distribution**

Models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate and independence of events.
Often used in queuing theory and telecommunications.


**Exponential Distribution**

Models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.
Often used in reliability analysis and survival studies.
