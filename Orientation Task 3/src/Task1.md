Every time a new age is drawn, roll dice and assign an unequal distribution of dice faces to each age range.
Then roll dice up to the maximum - minimum of that range and add it to the minimum to get the final age.
For example, if the age range is 20-30, roll a d6 and assign faces 1-3 to 20-24 and faces 4-6 to 25-30.
If you roll a 2, then roll a d5 (30-20=10, so d10 but only need to add 0-4) and add it to 20 to get the final age.
