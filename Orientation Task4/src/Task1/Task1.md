# Hospital/Clinic example

## Directly observable variables:

A: How many patients visit the hospital/clinic daily?

C: How many patients receive treatment daily?

B: Total daily treatment time available from all doctors daily.

T: Total time observed.

Ri: Average time a patient spends in the hospital/clinic (from arrival to departure).

W: Total time a patient spends waiting before treatment.

## Derived variables:

U: Utilization rate of doctors = B / T

This can be used to assess how effectively the doctors' time is being used.

<br>

X: Patient throughput rate = C / T

This can be used to evaluate how many patients are being treated per unit of time.

<br>

S: Average service time per patient = B / C 

This can be used to determine the average time spent on treating each patient.

<br>

R: Average response time per patient = Ri / A

This can be used to measure how long, on average, a patient spends in the hospital/clinic.

<br>

N: Average waiting time per day = W / T
