Observing a Bank as an example, by far the largest variability occurs in the customerbase. While online banking has untethered the banks operations from being entirely dependant on a physical offices opening times, the amount of users even a relatively large bank has to service fluctuates rapidly every day.
A banks automated virtual systems also experience the stress of market shifts in almost-real-time, with the customerbase following closely behind.

I imagine any combinatorial complexity largely arises from the banks bookkeeping computers, whereas the dynamic complexity comes from the large number of other users, services and customers interacting with those services.
